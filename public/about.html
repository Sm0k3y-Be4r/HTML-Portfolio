<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Damani Howell, a quantity surveying and civil engineering graduate transitioning into tech,</br> 
  combining a builder’s mindset with a developer’s curiosity. With a background in measurement, cost </br>
  planning, and project delivery from construction, I bring rigorous attention to detail, structured </br>
  problem‑solving, and clear communication to every codebase. Before learning to code, I worked as</br> 
  a Trainee Estimator and spent several years in logistics and operations, where I learned how to</br> 
  keep complex processes moving, collaborate in teams, and deliver reliably under time </br>
  pressure—habits I now apply to writing clean, maintainable software.</p>

<p>What I’m learning
Right now, I’m building foundations in programming and web development through</br>
 hands‑on projects. I focus on translating real‑world problems into simple, testable solutions, documenting</br> 
 assumptions, and iterating quickly—much like preparing a BoQ or a cost plan in NRM2. My current goals are</br>
 to deepen my front‑end skills, practice version control and collaborative workflows, and ship small, </br>
  well‑scoped projects that demonstrate clear value and measurable outcomes</p>

<p>As I grow my developer toolkit, I’ll publish projects that reflect the same discipline used in </br>
  estimating—clear scope, sensible architecture, thoughtful trade‑offs, and measurable impact. Expect small apps</br>
   first, then larger case studies with problem statements, tech stacks, challenges, and outcomes. </br>
   If the work resonates, reach out—collaborations, feedback, and learning opportunities are all welcome.</p>
